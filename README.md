Overview:
The semantic search engine consists of several components:
Data Ingestion: Fetches resumes from specified URLs, preprocesses them, and generates embeddings.
Vector Database: Initializes a database for storing resume embeddings.
Semantic Search API: Provides an API endpoint for querying resumes based on semantic similarity.
Front-End Interface: A Streamlit web application for users to interact with the semantic search engine.
